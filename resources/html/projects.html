    Feel free to take any of my code and reuse it. I would prefer credit
    somewhere, preferably visible, but comments are okay too.

        >A11y Ally</a
      >
      - An accessibility testing tool for Android developers and QAs to check
      for issues in their applications in real-time. By running as an
      accessibility tool, A11y Ally perceives other apps the way screen readers
      do and can visualize the experience that users dependent on screen readers
      have.

      <a href="https://github.com/quittle/JSS">JSS</a>
      - A CSS postcompiler in a single JS file. It allows you to write CSS with
      Javascript-style notation so variables and functions can be used within
      your site at runtime to generate the CSS on the fly. It's like
      <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a>
      but without any compiling or server-side dependencies.

      <a href="https://dramaticzoom.com">Dramatic Zoom</a>
      - A just-for-fun image sharing service that takes users' images and zooms
      in on them to a dramatic soundtrack. No longer actively maintained.

      <a href="https://github.com/quittle/wowser">Wowser</a>
      - After working on Chromium in a previous role, I decided to learn Rust
      and explore what it takes to build a browser from scratch at the same
      time. The goal is to explore as many aspects of Rust as possible while
      implementing nearly all components from scratch from the network stack to
      rendering to the Javascript engine.

    <li>
      <a href="https://commentube.dustintoff.com">CommenTube</a>
      - A commenting page for YouTube videos with complete anonymnity. It allows
      users to give feedback to filmmakers through visual and textual feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://fallingsand.dustintoff.com">Falling Sand</a>
      - A falling sand game clone in Javascript and Canvas. Click and drag to
      drop various elements for different effects.

      Mobile Site - This website is mobile friendly. It might not work as well
      on older devices as I don't have many to test with.

        >Boot Animation Shuffle</a
      >
      - Android app I made that randomizes your device's boot animation. It
      includes a market for people to upload, share and download animations. You
      can also generate custom text animations or auto-create photo slideshows
      from images on your device.

      Quick Utility - Easily toggle settings or launch an app anywhere in
      Android by long-pressing the search key.
    </li>
    <li>
      Web-based File Manager/Console - A JavaScript- and Canvas-based file
      manager and console interacting with a Perl backend using AJAX. I wanted
      to manage my files easier than SFTP, so I did my best to copy the
      click-and-drag feel of modern file managers. I also added a handy feature
      at the bottom; a console to execute programs on the backend. As far as
      I've found, it was a pretty novel idea. I could "cd" through the console
      or use a keyboard or clicks to navigate. The console would take input and
      display output from programs you wanted to execute. As I worked further on
      this project, I quickly realized how dangerous it was to have lying around
      publicly displayed, even with authentication, so I discontinued work on it
      and have since taken it down.
