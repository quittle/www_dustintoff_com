    Feel free to take any of my code and reuse it. I would prefer credit
    somewhere, preferably visible, but comments are okay too.

      - Having worked on

        >the Silk browser</a
      >
      (a <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/">Chromium</a> fork) years ago
      at Amazon, I decided try my hand at building a browser from scratch while
      learning Rust at the same time. Still a work in progress, I challenged
      myself to do so using only a minimum set of external crates. So far I've
      built a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph_Bitmap_Distribution_Format"
        >BDF</a
      >
      font parser, an HTML layout renderer leveraging OpenGL, a CSS parser and
      style engine, a Javascript interpreter, an HTTP networking stack, and much
      more.

        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quittle.a11yally"
        >A11y Ally</a
      >
      - An accessibility testing tool for Android developers and QAs to check
      for issues in their applications in real-time. By running as an
      accessibility tool, A11y Ally perceives other apps the way screen readers
      do and can visualize the experience that users dependent on screen readers
      have.

    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/quittle/JSS">JSS</a>
      - A CSS postcompiler in a single JS file. It allows you to write CSS with
      Javascript-style notation so variables and functions can be used within
      your site at runtime to generate the CSS on the fly. It's like
      <a href="http://lesscss.org">LESS</a>
      but without any compiling or server-side dependencies.

      <a href="https://github.com/quittle/www_dramaticzoom_com"
        >Dramatic Zoom</a
      >
      - A just-for-fun image sharing service that takes users' images and zooms
      in on them to a dramatic soundtrack. The website is no longer active.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://commentube.dustintoff.com">CommenTube</a>
      - A commenting page for YouTube videos with complete anonymnity. It allows
      users to give feedback to filmmakers through visual and textual feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://fallingsand.dustintoff.com">Falling Sand</a>
      - A falling sand game clone in Javascript and Canvas. Click and drag to
      drop various elements for different effects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mobile Site - This website is mobile friendly. It might not work as well
      on older devices as I don't have many to test with.
    </li>
    <li>
      Boot Animation Shuffle - Android app I made that randomizes your device's
      boot animation. It includes a market for people to upload, share and
      download animations. You can also generate custom text animations or
      auto-create photo slideshows from images on your device.
    </li>
    <li>
      Quick Utility - Easily toggle settings or launch an app anywhere in
      Android by long-pressing the search key.
    </li>
    <li>
      Web-based File Manager/Console - A JavaScript- and Canvas-based file
      manager and console interacting with a Perl backend using AJAX. I wanted
      to manage my files easier than SFTP, so I did my best to copy the
      click-and-drag feel of modern file managers. I also added a handy feature
      at the bottom; a console to execute programs on the backend. As far as
      I've found, it was a pretty novel idea. I could "cd" through the console
      or use a keyboard or clicks to navigate. The console would take input and
      display output from programs you wanted to execute. As I worked further on
      this project, I quickly realized how dangerous it was to have lying around
      publicly displayed, even with authentication, so I discontinued work on it
      and have since taken it down.
