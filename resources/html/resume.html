        Embedded in Meta&rsquo;s Integrity organization, which keeps users safe
        from harm (think spam, illicit content, criminal activity, and much
        more) across the company&rsquo;s many platforms, I help my team align
        the wide range of integrity teams on standardized practices to protect
        user privacy. As tech lead on my team, I drive discussions with partner
        teams across the company, proposing and aligning processes, designing
        solutions, and leveraging teammates to help design and implement
        subprojects. The work I have done has provided data and influence on the
        <a href="https://hacklang.org">Hack language</a> and reduced load on
        Integrity teams responding to
        <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/category/data-and-privacy"

        </h3>
        After moving to London, I built tools and services for the Prime Video
        Living Room Infrastructure and Tooling team to make developers more
        efficient. Living room devices present unique challenges as many &ndash;
        like smart TVs or set-top boxes &ndash; are not designed to be
        developer-friendly, or are computationally low powered. Enabling
        developers as much freedom as possible to build for and test on these
        restricted and limited platforms was my goal on this team, be it through
        simplifying the build-test lifecycle, reducing build times, or scaling
        dependent services efficiently so that they don't need to worry about
        it.

        Joining at the conception of this service, I lead architecture designs
        with responsibilities ranging from AWS authorization primitives to
        AWS-level scaling and availability considerations to customer network
        integrations. I researched and built critical components of the
        service's control plane including deployment, scaling, storage, and
        monitoring. Starting with little domain expertise, I developed a wider
        skill set and learned many new technical skills along the way.
