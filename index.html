                          </h3>
                          Now based in London, I build tools and services for
                          the Prime Video Living Room Infrastructure and Tooling
                          team to make developers more efficient. Living room
                          devices present unique challenges as many &ndash; like
                          smart TVs or set-top boxes &ndash; are not designed to
                          be developer-friendly, or are computationally low
                          powered. Enabling developers as much freedom as
                          possible to build for and test on these restricted and
                          limited platforms is my goal on this team, be it
                          through simplifying the build-test lifecycle, reducing
                          build times, or scaling dependent services efficiently
                          so that they don't need to worry about it.

                          </h3>
                          Joining at the conception of this service, I lead
                          architecture designs with responsibilities ranging
                          from AWS authorization primitives to AWS-level scaling
                          and availability considerations to customer network
                          integrations. I researched and built critical
                          components of the service's control plane including
                          deployment, scaling, storage, and monitoring. Starting
                          with little domain expertise, I developed a wider
                          skill set and learned many new technical skills along
                          the way.

                        After working on Chromium in a previous role, I decided
                        to learn Rust and explore what it takes to build a
                        browser from scratch at the same time. The goal is to
                        explore as many aspects of Rust as possible while
                        implementing nearly all components from scratch from the
                        network stack to rendering to the Javascript engine.

                        Web-based File Manager/Console - A JavaScript- and
                        Canvas-based file manager and console interacting with a
                        Perl backend using AJAX. I wanted to manage my files
                        easier than SFTP, so I did my best to copy the
                        click-and-drag feel of modern file managers. I also
                        added a handy feature at the bottom; a console to
                        execute programs on the backend. As far as I've found,
                        it was a pretty novel idea. I could "cd" through the
                        console or use a keyboard or clicks to navigate. The
                        console would take input and display output from
                        programs you wanted to execute. As I worked further on
                        this project, I quickly realized how dangerous it was to
                        have lying around publicly displayed, even with
                        authentication, so I discontinued work on it and have
                        since taken it down.
